Assignment: PHP Application - Zombie Apocalypse Simulation with Docker Compose and 
Apache Web Server

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to create and deploy a PHP application that simulates a 
zombie apocalypse scenario. You will utilize a PostgreSQL database, Docker Compose for 
environment management, and an Apache container as the web server. The application should 
allow users to interact with the simulation through a web browser.

Requirements:
1. Develop a PHP application that simulates a zombie apocalypse scenario.
2. Use Docker Compose to set up and manage the application's environment, including a 
PostgreSQL database container and an Apache web server container.
3. The simulation should include various elements such as humans, zombies, and resources 
(e.g., weapons, food, medical supplies).
4. Implement the necessary logic to simulate the interactions between humans, zombies, and 
resources. Please KEEP IT SIMPLE, IT'S JUST AN ASSIGNMENT! :)
5. Use the PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve relevant simulation data, such as the 
current state of humans, zombies, and available resources.
6. Configure the Apache web server container to serve the PHP application and allow access 
via a web browser.
7. Write a README file with clear instructions on how to run the application and access it 
via a web browser.

Guidelines:
1. Use PHP to develop the application logic. You can choose any PHP framework (such as 
Laravel, Symfony, or plain PHP) or develop the application from scratch.
2. Utilize the PostgreSQL database for storing and retrieving simulation data. Design a 
suitable database schema that represents the various entities and their relationships.
3. Use Docker Compose to define and orchestrate the necessary containers for the application, 
including a PostgreSQL database container and an Apache web server container.
4. Ensure that the application container, PostgreSQL container, and Apache web server 
container are properly connected and can communicate with each other.
5. Configure the Apache web server container to serve the PHP application by mounting the 
application code into the appropriate web server directory.
6. Expose the necessary ports for accessing the PHP application via a web browser.
7. Implement the simulation logic, including rules for interactions, movement, infection, 
resource consumption, etc.
8. The README file should contain clear instructions on how to:
 - Build and run the Docker Compose environment.
 - Access the PHP application via a web browser.
 - Interact with the simulation (e.g., adding humans, spawning zombies, allocating 
resources).
 - View the current state of the simulation and any relevant information.
 
Evaluation Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
1. Correctness: Does the PHP application simulate the zombie apocalypse scenario 
accurately? Are the interactions and rules implemented correctly?
2. Docker Compose Usage: Did you successfully set up the environment using Docker 
Compose? Are the containers properly connected?
3. Code Quality: Is the PHP code well-organized and maintainable? Does it follow best 
practices?
4. Database Interaction: Is the PostgreSQL database effectively utilized for storing and 
retrieving simulation data?
5. Web Server Configuration: Is the Apache web server container properly configured to 
serve the PHP application?
6. Simulation Interactivity: Can users interact with the simulation through the web browser? 
Is the user interface intuitive and responsive?
7. Documentation: Is the README file comprehensive and easy to follow? Are the 
instructions accurate and clear?

Submission:
You should submit a compressed folder (e.g., ZIP) containing the following:
1. The PHP application code.
2. The Docker Compose configuration file.
3. The Apache web server configuration file (if applicable).
4. The README file with instructions.
Please note that the code should be well-commented, and the application should be tested 
thoroughly before submission.
Good luck with your assignment!
